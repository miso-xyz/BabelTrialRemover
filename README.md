# BabelTrialRemover
Remove/Disable Babel Obfuscator 30 Day limit from apps (tested on 9.7.5.0)

# Note
if you just don't want the trial restriction without getting your application bricked just select `Disable 30 Day Trial Code`, it'll still be present in the app but will be unused

# Options
<pre>
Remove 30 Day Trial Code | Unstable, will likely brick the targetted assembly
Disable/Enable 30 Day Trial Code | Stable, works perfectly

ToDo:
- Get Remaining time
</pre>
